# 🚗 Vision in Motion: Intelligent Object Detection with YOLOv8 🎥

## 📱 Project Overview
Welcome to Vision in Motion, a state-of-the-art object detection application built with YOLOv8 and Streamlit! This interactive web app allows users to upload videos, detect objects in real-time, and visualize the results with bounding boxes and labels. Whether you're working with security footage, analyzing traffic, or exploring AI, this tool offers a seamless experience for intelligent object detection.

## ✨ Key Features:

  - 🔎 Real-Time Object Detection: Detects and labels objects in videos using YOLOv8.
  - 🎯 Confidence Threshold Control: Adjust detection confidence to filter out weak predictions.
  - 📹 Video Playback: Upload and play videos directly in the app with live object detection.
  - ⚡ Efficient Frame Processing: Process every nth frame to enhance performance and reduce computation time.
  - 🖼 Customizable UI: With a beautiful, dynamic background, the app is designed to engage users visually while showcasing intelligent technology in action.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
  - YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once): A cutting-edge model for real-time object detection 🧠
  - Streamlit: A powerful framework to build interactive web applications in Python 💻
  - OpenCV: For video processing and frame manipulation 📷
  - PyTorch: The backbone for deep learning 🧑‍💻
  - Base64 Encoding: For embedding custom background images 🔒

## 🖥 How It Works
  - Upload Your Video: Choose an MP4 or AVI file to upload.
  - Set Detection Parameters: Adjust the confidence threshold and frame interval to fine-tune detection.
  - Object Detection: The app processes the video frame-by-frame, detecting objects with YOLOv8.
  - Visual Output: View detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels, updated in real-time.
  - Optimized for Performance: Process large videos efficiently using frame intervals to speed up the system.
